# DevOps Ottawa Meetup
Welcome to [DevOps Ottawa Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Ottawa/)!

### Goal
Build a strong local cloud development and DevOps community.  

### Format
Quarterly meetup with a "show and tell" format.  We rotate to different local companies who host and share what they've learned in the cloud development and DevOps space.  

### What's required to host?
Hosts are required to come up with the talks and provide the pizza/drinks.  Hosts usually provide the venue as well but we can help with that if you don't have the space.

### What is the agenda for a typical meetup?
A typical meetup involves a few speaker presentations and some time for Q&A. Speaker presentations usually vary from one to three presenters who typically speak from 30 minutes to one hour. The meetup usually runs from 6:30 - 8:30 PM.

### How many guests will be invited?
The entire meetup group will be invited and typically 40-50 people attend.  

### Why host?
In addition to building a stronger local development community, hosting a meetup is great way to get visibility for your company and network with local developers.  As a host, you can gain visibility in the following ways:
- Listing as a sponsor on the meetup.com page left column.
- Listing in the meetup event page event details.
- Thank you in the post-event email to the group.
- Network with developers during the break between talks.
