# DevOps Ottawa Meetup Sponsorship Guidelines

 Our goal is to help build a stronger local cloud development and DevOps community.  We need your help!

## Why sponsor?

Sponsoring a meetup is great way to get visibility for your company and network with local developers.  As a sponsor, you can gain visibility in the following ways:
- Listing as a sponsor on the meetup.com page left column
- Listing in the meetup event page event details
- Thank you in the post-event email
- Verbal thank you in the opening remarks
- 2-5 minute intro at the beginning of the event
- Mention in Social Media when promoting the meetup (LinkedIn and Twitter)
- Option to setup a table, bring some handouts and swag.  
- Network with developers during the 15 minute break between talks.

Meetups provide opportunities to learn about new technology, exchange ideas, share successes and failures, and build a stronger network.  We all benefit from a strong local development community.  

There are three sponsorship options available:
- Venue Host sponsorship
- Food / Beverage sponsorship
- Venue + Food / Beverage sponsorship

## Venue Host Sponsorship
As the venue host, you will provide the event space, Wi-Fi and a projector.

## Food / Beverage Sponsorship
As the food/beverage sponsors, you will pay for the pizza and pop (typically $200).  We will coordinate ordering and delivery.  We can send you an PO invoice to provide any required paperwork.
